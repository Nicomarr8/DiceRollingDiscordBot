# DiceRollingDiscordBot
This is the code for a discord bot I build to allow members of servers I am on to roll dice of various sizes and quantities. I play a lot of board games that use polyhedral dice and a tool like this is very useful.

The code is written in Python and utilizes Discord's Python API. This is the 2nd version of it as Discord's API and Libraries went through an update that changed the way bots are built. As a result the previous version became outdated and I had to rebuild it.
